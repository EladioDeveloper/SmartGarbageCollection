# SmartGarbageCollection
This is a website app for our smart garbage collection system, which generates the most efficient route based on containers location.

We used an ESP8266, with 3 distance sensors, each one measuring one container.

Our goal is to improve our local garbage collection system which is inefficient when it comes to routes, and solving the problem of full containers with trash in their surroundings.
